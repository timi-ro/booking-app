# Authenticating requests

To authenticate requests, include an **`Authorization`** header with the value **`"Bearer {YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN}"`**.

All authenticated endpoints are marked with a `requires authentication` badge in the documentation below.

This API uses Laravel Sanctum for authentication. Include your bearer token in the Authorization header.
